This is apparently ARM's armulator.  I got it from gdb.

I ripped out all the v5, v6, etc stuff, ripped out Xscale and 26 bit
arm.  Ripped out coprocessor stuff, leaving an arm v4T. blx is a
v5 instruction so make sure you specify -march=armv4t otherwise your
(thumb) code may not work.

I have both the arm and thumb test programs working, and I ran 
asteroids on it which wasnt a trivial thing so it is not completely
broken.  I may still have holes in it though, not having a blx 
instruction took me a while to figure out.

armulator.c is an example of how to use this instruction set simulator.

Use the PutWord and GetWord functions for hooks into implmenting
your own peripherals.
